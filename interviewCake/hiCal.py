"""
Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. 
You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available. 

In HiCal, a meeting is stored as a tuple â†´ of integers (start_time, end_time). 
These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am. 

Be sure to consider these edge cases:

    The end time of the first meeting and the start time of the second meeting are equal. 
    For example: [(1, 2), (2, 3)]
    The second meeting ends before the first meeting ends. For example: [(1, 5), (2, 3)]

 Here's a formal algorithm:

    1) We treat the meeting with earlier start time as "first," and the other as "second."
    2) If the end time of the first meeting is equal to or greater than the start time of the second meeting, 
        we merge the two meetings into one time range. 
        The resulting time range's start time is the first meeting's start, 
        and its end time is the later of the two meetings' end times.
    3) Else, we leave them separate.
