collections.namedtuple()

Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for 
    accessing members of a tuple.

Task:
Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's
IDs, marks, class and name.

Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average 
    marks of the students.

Average = Sum of all marks / Total Students
    
Note:
1. Columns can be in any order. 
    IDs, marks, class and name can be written in any order
      in the spreadsheet.
2. Column names are ID, MARKS, CLASS and NAME. 
    (The spelling and case type of these names won't change.)
