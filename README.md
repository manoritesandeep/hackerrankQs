## Python codes

# This is more of a Python repo of codes and other tricks... nothing specific

You are free to use any code you like... Send feedback all the good stuff...

Most of the code in this repo are based of HackerRank questions...

The code was initially tested using PyCharm in venv python 3.8... 
In case any use case changes to be made can be done...

Thanks, Enjoy!
